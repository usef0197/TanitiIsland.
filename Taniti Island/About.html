                    <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific
                        . While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, 
                        the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, 
                        a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous
                         interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous
                          population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the
                           Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
